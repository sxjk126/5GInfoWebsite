	<h2>What is 5G?</h2>
	<p>5G as what it states, is the fifth mobile network, and its effectiveness and powerfulness surpass all the previous one.</p>
	
	<p>5G will promote mobile network effectiveness, not only through connecting as network between one another, but also connect machines, products, and network ends. It will achieve higher level of effectiveness and power, bestow people new technology experience and create new fields of industries. 5G will provide as far as multiple of Gigabytes of speed, limited delay, enormous capacities and unified, integrated customer experience. The most obvious factor that 5G bring us is faster speed while in the mean time lower energy consumption. From 4G LTE to 5G, Bytes per unit in cost of transferring in 5G will decrease 1000 times compared to 4G LTE while in the mean time the cost of telecommunication will decrease 1000 times.</p>
    <h2>What are those previous mobile network?</h2>
	
<ol>
	<p> These previous mobile network are 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G.</P>
	<b><li>1G</li></b>
	<p>1G transfer analog information, such as voice.</p>
	<b><li>2G</li></b>
	<p>2G brought us digital information of voice, such as CDMA and we are able to send text messages beside call people over the phone.</p>
	<b><li>3G </li></b>
	<p>3G brought us mobile data, such as CDMA 2000 which enable us to surf on the Internet, sending emails over the phone.</p>
	<b><li>4G</li></b>
	<p>4G LTE create mobile network era, which let us watching videos, listening music, controlling equipments.</p>
	
	<p>These previous mobile network are not outdated yet. Especially 4G LTE and 3G are still used by people daily.  </p> 
</ol>
	<h2>What are the advantages of 5G compared to previous ones?</h2>
	<p> 5G is a new network. This platform of innovation not only will improve current Internet service, but also extend the mobile network to the degree of enormous information and data transferring dynamically, connect new type of industries. At the same time, 5G is able to provide higher performance, more effective and efficiency, lower cost of operation. 5G will redefine most of Internet industry fields which providing multiple Internet related service, including retail, education, transportation, entertainment and all the areas among them. 5G will be as powerful as when cars and electricity were created.</p> 

	<p> Qualcomm found in an economic research of 5G that, by the time in 2035, 5G will affect the whole economy in the world, provide support for multiple industries, and may bring us 12 trillion US dollars of products and services. It also manifest that, by 2035, the 5G value chain (OEM, carriers, content creators, software developers, and customers) is able to create up to 3.5 trillion US dollars of revenue and support up to 22 million jobs. </p> 

	<h2>What type of service and products 5G can provide us?</h2>
	<p> In general, 5G can provide us 3 different categories of network service.</p>
	<p>Augmented mobile band width: 5G not only improve our smartphone, but also bring us new immersive experience, such as VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality), and more integrated speed of data transfer, lower delay, and of course lower cost per unit.
</p> 

	<p> Key service: 5G will provide new service through pretty reliable and feasible low delay to renovate multiple industries, such as infrastructure, car, and medical service.</p>  

	<p> Huge Internet of things: 5G will provide simple and low cost solution by providing decrease speed of data transfer,  power consumption, and mobility. It can connect enormous embedded sensors to be suitable on everything.</p> 
	<h2>How fast can 5G be?</h2>
	<p>According to the requirement of IMT-2000, 5G highest speed can be up to 20 Gbps. However, 5G is not limited to just “fast”. Besides of fast, 5G will extend new spectrum, such as mmWave can provide larger network capacity. 5G can also decrease delay, so that it can provide real time response and provide integrated customer experience. 5G will make high speed mobile Internet possible for customer when they are traveling fast, for example when they are riding high speed train and enjoy high speed Internet.</p>
